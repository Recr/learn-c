Here are some projects that I made in the process of learning programming logic and the C language.



# Projects:

* [Quadratic Equation]([#Quadratic_equation](https://github.com/Recr/learn-c/blob/main/Quadratic_equation/quadratic_equation.c))

	A program that returns the roots of a quadratic equation if there are solution.

* Primes
	
	A program that returns which number are primes in the specified range.
